# MusicMoodBoard
Mood Board iOS Application intended for musicians, to be used to quickly pull up a genre of songs and listen to a few tracks for inspiration


User can select a genre (listed in a custom collectionView), then pick one of the listed tracks (listed in a TableView), which will then present the track with the options to play and pause, with a progress bar shown to indicate duration of track.
